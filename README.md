This project was originally a coding challenge from IGN, which can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jmbice/IGN-FE">another repo</a>. I added a couple UI features for fun and tried a couple additional Webpack optimizations as well:
<br/><br/>
ADDED: <br/>
• Loading spinner, scroll up menu (mobile), better custom breakpoint sizes with design centered on mobile <br/>
• Code splitting<br/>
• Tree shaking<br/>
• React Router implementation for better UX in browser and to allow for URL based web crawling<br/>
• Heroku deployment<br/>
