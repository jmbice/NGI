This project was originally a coding challenge from IGN, which can be found on another <a href="https://github.com/jmbice/IGN-FE">repo</a>. I added a couple UI features to the orginal for fun, and I tried a couple Webpack optimizations as well:

ADDED:
• Loading spinner, scroll up menu (mobile), better custom breakpoint sizes with design centered on mobile 
• Code splitting
• Tree shaking
• React Router implementation for better UX in browser and to allow for URL based web crawling
• Heroku deployment
