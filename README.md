# NGI

This project was originally a coding challenge from IGN, which can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jmbice/IGN-FE">another repo</a>. I added a couple UI features for fun and tried a couple additional Webpack optimizations as well: <br/> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;  • Loading spinner, scroll up menu (mobile), better custom breakpoint sizes with design centered on mobile <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  • Code splitting<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  • Tree shaking<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  • React Router implementation for better UX in browser and to allow for URL based web crawling<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  • Heroku deployment<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To run locally, <br/>
  • Download and run NPM install<br/>
  • npm start (start server)<br/>
  • npm run dev (start compiling in developer mode)<br/>
  • npm run prod (start compoling in production mode)<br/>
  • API calls will only yield data if your connected to the internet<br/><br/>
